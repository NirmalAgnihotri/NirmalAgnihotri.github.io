### Experience
1. Feeding San Diego
   - Created a user friendly web app to help Feeding San Diego manage food distribution. The app allows the user to update, search, and view large amounts of information in an organized manner while being far more UI friendly than a massive excel spreadsheet. Project uses the MERN stack. I am currently using REACT to create front-end elements such as the navbar and data table and using Mongo to manage and create the database.
2. United Women of East Africa Kitchen Website
   - Created a website where customers of the United Women of East Africa kitchen service are able to order food. Worked with Mongo, JQuery, CSS and HTML to create cart functionality and a user-friendly table to manage a large database of orders.
3. AP US History Review App
   - Created a Java Application in high school to help students prepare for the AP US History Exam. The application featured simple UI and would add additional information upon correct answers to help contextualize information.
